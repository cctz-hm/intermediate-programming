## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Reflection 

a short reflection (2-3 sentences) on whether or not you used recursion (why or why not), what you had trouble with, how you overcame those troubles, and what would you do more if you had more time. 

I didn't use recursion because the code for iterative loops was easier to follow and manage. One challenge was making sure all the errors and exceptions were caught, especially when handling non-integer inputs. I would create Games in seperate classes and create a final score after multiple rounds. 

## Updated Reflection 
For the extra credit, I learned about Classes and created multiple rounds for the game. In the future, I want to try the hangman game
